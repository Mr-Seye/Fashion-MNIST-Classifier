# üß† Fashion-MNIST-Classifier

A convolutional neural network (CNN) pipeline built with PyTorch for classifying Fashion-MNIST images. This project is presented in a Jupyter Notebook and structured as a step-by-step tutorial to guide users through the full machine learning workflow, from data loading to evaluation.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fashion-MNIST-Classifier.git
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter:

jupyter notebook Fashion-MNIST-Classifier.ipynb

3. Run all cells in order.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

You can edit key hyperparameters in the notebook:

    batch_size_train / batch_size_test

    Number and size of convolutional layers

    learning_rate

    optimizer (use any valid PyTorch optimizer by name)

    num_epochs

This allows experimentation and learning with different configurations of the CNN model.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed (all are imported in the notebook):

    Python

    Jupyter

    numpy

    matplotlib

    PyTorch

    torchvision

Optional: install using pip
````
pip install numpy matplotlib torch torchvision notebook
````
